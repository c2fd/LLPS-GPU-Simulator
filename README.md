# LLPS-GPU-Simulator
Eukaryotic cells have evolved multiple mechanisms for establishing and maintaining intracellular chemical compartments required to perform specific functions.Such mechanisms are essential as they override diffusive homogenization that smooths the required chemical gradients for spatial regulation of processes and that drive intracellular transport. We focus on cytoplasmic compartments that arise from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and function to establish and preserve cytoplasmic heterogeneity in mRNA localization and expression.
